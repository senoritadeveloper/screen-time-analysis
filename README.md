# screen-time-analysis


# In this project I analysed a dataset that contains usage, notifications and openings of mobile applications Instagram and Whatsapp.

# Used plot functions to show data and the relationship between the notifications and openings of the apps, conlusion is that as many notifications as we get, as much as we will open the application.
